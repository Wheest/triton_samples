    Some home-brewed Triton kernels, with varying degrees of optimisation
  </p>
</div>

As I've been exploring Triton, I've written some kernels.
I've put some of them here for public use, though note that many of these kernels just implement correctness, rather than using every optimisation under the sun.
This repo has no official connection to the Triton project.

This was tested using `triton==2.2.0` and `torch==2.1.2`
